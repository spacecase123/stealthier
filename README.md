stealthier aims to collect data from van & vehicle dwelling people to share our collective knowledge about specific locations and resources available to us. Some examples include clutch overnight parking spots, public wifi spots you can reach from your van. 

**In building this app, there are a few considerations I'd like to mention here...**

### Users do not need to sign up to submit to the database
> This decision was made because I want people to submit things without worry about their personal data being linked to this project.

### Users do no have the ability to delete or update listings
> The database will be monitored by a group of volunteers to ensure that data on stealthier is helpful, friendly, and safe. If you'd like to be one of these volunteers, reach out to me on twitter [@queeryselector](https://twitter.com/queeryselector)

### v.0.1.0 is a starting point...
> There are a LOT of features that are not currently implemented in version 0.1.0. My hope is that the community can help drive development and help determine which features are built first. These things currently include... 
> * filter listings by data type (location, resources, etc.)
> * photo uploads on listings
> * allow users to verify listings submitted by others
> * interactive map with pins for all listings

## Contributors
> If you're a developer and would like to contribute, please reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/queeryselector). stealthier is built with [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/)
> Even if you're not familiary with Svelte, still consider contributing; Svelte is very friendly and feels like writing plain HTML & JS, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!
